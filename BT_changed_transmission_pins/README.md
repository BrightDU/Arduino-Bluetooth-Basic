BT_changed_transmission_lines.ino code consist of a library 'SoftwareSerial'.

This Library allows you to select your own Tx and Rx pins.

For eg: in code (3,2) is taken which means pin 3 of MCU is connected with Rx of BT and pin 2 to Tx of BT.

So, now you can use default Tx,Rx pins for other modules.

You can define another Tx,Rx using the same method as used for previous one.
